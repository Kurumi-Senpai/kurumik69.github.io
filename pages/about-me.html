        I graduated High School with 
        High Honors, I Am now in college 
        working on a Computer Science. I 
        was also the Leader of the High School 
        Marching band this meant i was in 
        charge of of most sections of the band 
        which include the High Woodwinds (Flutes, Clarinets)
        Woodwinds (Altosaxes, Tenor Saxes), High Brass (Trumpets, 
        French Horn), Low Brass (Sousaphone, Bari-Sax). 
        I believe this has given me experience, while not 
        enough to cordinate major or large scale events I 
        believe it can be of help if ever needed.
